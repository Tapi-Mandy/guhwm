## Installing *Guh Window Manager*

### Use this command to install guhwm-1.0
> [!TIP]
> We recommend using [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) with a Xorg or minimal desktop profile to set up your base system, and then installing guhwm

> ~~`sudo pacman -S git && git clone https://github.com/Tapi-Mandy/guhwm && cd guhwm && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`~~
